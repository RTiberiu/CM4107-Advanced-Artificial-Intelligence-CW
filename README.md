Project title: Sentiment Analysis on IMDb reviews using BiLSTM and ELECTRA  
Author: Tiberiu Rociu  
Student ID: 2006061  
Total word count: 915 words  
Dataset used: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kwaai/IMDB_Sentiment  
Python version: 3.12.8  

Note for marking purposes: Training the ELECTRA model might take a long time if a dedicated GPU is not used. For this reason I left notes for two code blocks that should be skipped if more powerful hardware is not available. The code block following those will import the trained custom ELECTRA model.
